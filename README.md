# AutoSkipYT

A simple Python script that automates skipping YouTube ads using Selenium by jumping to the end of the video ad. It simulates a real user session in Chrome and avoids bot detection to ensure smooth video playback

PROFILE CREATED WHEN FILE IS RUN

## Features

- Detects when an ad is playing
- Skips ads by seeking to the final second of the ad video
- Avoids YouTube automation detection (`navigator.webdriver` patch)
- Runs in visible Chrome window (not headless) for demo purposes
- Uses a clean temporary Chrome profile to avoid session issues

## How It Works

1. Launches a Chrome browser with a temporary profile
2. Navigates to YouTube and waits for a video to load
3. Detects ad overlays using YouTubeâ€™s internal class names
4. Jumps to the last second of the ad to skip it
5. Continues playback at normal speed if no ad is playing
